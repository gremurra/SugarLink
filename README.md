##Mission Statement
Our project will allow a user to log and track diabetes-related data. That data produces personal trends, and can be used to show medical professionals.



#Eleven Fifty Academy - Blue Badge Final Project
##Overview:

Your assignment is to build a .NET Framework API Web Application using n-tier architecture covering a topic of your group's choosing.

This API should include a minimum of three (3) custom (excluding the given user table) data tables, including at least one Foreign Key relationship between said tables.

Initial setup should include working together as a team to work through the planning stage. This stage should include:

A layout of what the database tables should look like and how they should interact (You might consider using a tool like dbdiagram.io (Links to an external site.))
You will need to review your idea and whiteboard this out with an instructor
Fill out the planning document attached to the project module
Break out the work load into consumable chunks, from your immediate TODOs to your long term stretch goals
 

##Requirements:

Come up with an idea for an application that will use a minimum of 3 custom data tables
Including at least one Foreign Key relationship
Create a wireframe of the application and review it with an instructor
Build out an n-tier structured API (think ElevenNote) with the following tiers
Data: This layer houses your classes that relate to the DB (POCOs, Identity, etc)
Models: This layer houses the reusable models for the rest of the layers
Services: This layer is where youâ€™ll have most of your heavy backend logic
Web API: This is where the controllers and API endpoints will be
Link to repository site on your deployed Portfolio
Repository has a README.md (Links to an external site.) associated with the project
 

##Interactivity:

As an addition to your API, you may consider adding a form of "front end" to your application.
This can be something like the Console Applications we've interacted with in the past.

This can be included in your project solution or as a stand alone application.

While this is not required, it might be a helpful addition if you find yourself completing the task earlier than expected.
